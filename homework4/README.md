### Object-Oriented Calculator

Design and implement application which runs in CLI and provides shell-like access to its functionality.

* Calculator has to be designed in an object-oriented way
* Design and build your application with help of Spring Boot and Spring Shell projects
* It should support at least unary and binary arithmetic operations applied on custom number of operands


There are no special requirements to the way the app interacts with user. Feel free to choose the one you would like to implement or take one of these:

```sh
calculator$ add 10 20
calculator$ 30
```

```sh
calculator$ 10 + 20
calculator$ 30
```

Please focus on designing the OO model and mapping it to Spring beans, etc.
